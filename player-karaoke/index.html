	<p>Well there she goes walking away I wish her well
	There she goes wish she’d stay and I wish her well</p>

	<p>And I hope and pray, sometimes, that she’ll come back
	Change her mind oh nevermore in time to tell</p>

	<p>There she goes and I wish her well</p>

	<p>Yes I’ll miss her so and I’ll always look
	She was good and kind as she could be</p>

	<p>Oh I see it now how I feel it now
	But it’s too late all I’ve got is misery</p>

	<p>There she goes walking away I wish her well oh yes I do
	Lost my world my everything I wish her well</p>

	<p>And I hope someday she’ll find the love she wants
	Peace of mind still I’d take her back again</p>

	<p>There she goes I wish her well</p>

	<p>There she goes walking away I wish her well</p>
